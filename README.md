Hello! Here are instructions to playing "A Night Among The Trees" by Kieran Coe.

First, click on the "<> code" button and download this repository as a zip file.
Once that is downloaded, click on the folder and click "Extract All". Create an empty folder for your extraction destination.

Next, download the latest version of python. This can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/
Once the installer is downloaded, run the installer. MAKE SURE to click the box "Add Python 3.X to PATH" (X being the release number such as 11).

Next, go to the folder where the extracted files are and run your system terminal at this folder.
On windows, this is done by right clicking in an open space of the folder and choosing "Open In Terminal".

In the terminal, type in "python --version" to ensure python is downloaded. The version should be 3.X.
Next, type "pip list" to make sure pip is downloaded. If it gives you a short list, this is good! If it gives you an error, type in "python -m pip install --upgrade pip". Check to make sure it's loaded with "pip list".

MAKE SURE that the terminal is running at the location of the game's folder and that python and pip are both accessable here before the next step.
Once pip is installed, type in the following three lines one at a time:
"pip install opencv-python"
"pip install pygame"
"pip install inputimeout"

After all three are installed, close the terminal.
Next, click "RUN ME!" and the game should run!!!
